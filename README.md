Finance Expense Calculator

The purpose of this program is to keep track, and calculate total costs, organized by day. I will continue to add to this project as I learn more about Python. 

For the time being, the program will accept a number of expenses, and calculate the total and average. The entries are also added to an .xlsv file that is created using the CSV module.
